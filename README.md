## Pulse model analysis and synthesis

It is basically the vocoder suggested in:
> G. Degottex, P. Lanchantin, and M. Gales, "A Pulse Model in Log-domain
>    for a Uniform Synthesizer," in Proc. 9th Speech Synthesis Workshop
>    (SSW9), 2016.

### External tools
PML first aims at extracting a noise measure and synthesis a waveform assuming F0 curve and amplitude spectral envelopes are already given.

In order to make it a standalone vocoder, it was thus necessary to import an F0 estimator and an spectral envelope estimator.

For F0, a modified version of REAPER is used (github.com/google/REAPER).
    However, the modifications made to the original REAPER do NOT change the f0 estimation.
    They are only made for an easier interface with PML code.
    You can have a look at the modifications here:
    https://github.com/google/REAPER/compare/master...gillesdegottex:master

For the amplitude spectral envelope, the estimator CheapTrick is used (from the WORLD vocoder, without any modification).

    Masanori Morise, CheapTrick, a spectral envelope estimator for high-quality speech synthesis, Speech Communication, Volume 67, 2015, Pages 1-7, ISSN 0167-6393, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2014.09.003.

    Note that all the published results about PML have been done using the spectral envelope of the STRAIGHT vocoder, NOT using WORLD.
    Because of legal reason it is not possible to release any of STRAIGHT vocoder analysis. Thus, the use of CheapTrick instead in this repository.
    It also means that, even though STRAIGHT's envelope and CheapTrick are quite similar, you might observe small differences in results between the two.
